Jam Theme You Are The Weapon

This theme can be expressed in a number of different ways. Maybe you are cursed and become a weapon that other characters have to wield. Maybe you're an integrated organism that pilots a world destroying gun. Maybe you're Doom Guy. He's basically just a weapon, let's be real. Or even taking it a different direction maybe you're a weapon that kills things like viruses and saves people.

Whatever the case you exist to influence your surroundings in some direct way. Have fun with the theme and do something weird with it. Themes are like a box you have to find your way out of. An escape room for game development. Be creative.
